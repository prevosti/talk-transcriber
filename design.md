## Talk Transcriber - MVP
### Page design
- Upload file form
- "Transcribe" button
- Text area with transcribed text

### Behaviour
- user uploads audio file through file uploader
- app reads the file, saves to disk
- when "Transcribe" button is clicked, the file is sent to Speech to Text service, output is read, saved to disk and displayed in text area
